# odin-tictactoe
JS project for Odin to make a tic tac toe web browser game.

css and html were simple, the JS gave me some fits. 
Very complex to code the event listeners for the game and the change name function. 

I started building the game in the console and then created the ui for the game. That's the main reason that there
is both a games.js and ui.js. This made it a little easier to seperate my controller function, but I had to make tweaks to
figure out which variables should be global. 

Building the game in the console was a smart idea as doing both at the same time would have been near impossible. 
The game logic works as intended and is a project I can share!
